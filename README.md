# splatoon

`chmod +x splatoon.py`

Bind a key combination to run the program. Here is an i3 example:

`bindsym $mod+Shift+Ctrl+s exec "/usr/bin/python3 /home/buddy/splatoon/splatoon.py"`

Run your keybind, click 2 points on the mapview with all 10 spiders bound and set in your hotbar:

Now you can do anything!
